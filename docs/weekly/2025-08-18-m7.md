This week I captured live-session requirements, organized them into GitHub issues, and planned the dev→stage workflow.

## Requirements Captured
- #6 Capture Live-sessions requirements
- #7 Update docs weekly with summary of decisions
- #8 Prepare PRs and merge dev → stage for milestone 7

## Changes Implemented
- Created Milestone 7 and seeded issues
- Set up M7 Sprint board view
- Added weekly docs skeleton

## Testing & Evidence
- PRs: (add links after opening)
- Screenshots: (board + milestone)
- Commits: (SHAs after merge)

## Decisions & Follow-ups
- Open feature PR(s) into `dev`
- Tracking PR `dev` → `stage` after checks
- Add screenshots and finalize evidence
